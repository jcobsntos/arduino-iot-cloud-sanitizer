## üß™ Methodology
<details>
<summary> <strong>Prototyping Model</strong></summary>

<img width="663" height="348" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7645804c-3381-4496-9482-5ab733e2d734" />

<div align="justify">
The Prototyping Model is an iterative system development process that emphasizes ongoing improvement through feedback from the users. The model deviates from the linear methods, which instead enable an early development of a working prototype that is tested and refined according to user interactions. This method ensures the eventual delivery of a system that meets the users' requirements and reduces the risks and expense of changes in subsequent stages. The Prototyping Model has six main stages: Planning, Analysis, Design, System Prototype, Implementation, and System Maintenance

## üîå System Architecture

<details>
<summary> <strong> üß± Block Diagram</strong></summary>

<img width="891" height="712" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/beca3e5e-c001-4b08-b45e-41e213e392ad" />

<div align="justify">
As indicated from the block diagram, it is centered on the ESP32 microcontroller, which acts as the central unit controlling all the modules. The system is powered by a dedicated power supply that will run continuously. The contactless sanitizing module identifies and releases alcohol to sanitize hands without direct contact. The front-end information module, through the LCD display, shows real-time alcohol levels and system status to users. On the other hand, the back-end monitoring module tracks the system‚Äôs operational data‚Äîspecifically alcohol levels‚Äîand uses Internet of Things (IoT) to send this information to the cloud via Arduino Cloud; the backend also displays usage data on a chart, showcasing how many times the sensor has detected an object‚Äîi.e., how many times it has dispensed sanitizer‚Äîover selectable timeframes such as 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, and 15 days. An LED indicator system provides a visual representation of the alcohol level status: a green LED lights up when the tank is full, yellow when it's at a medium level, and red when the level is critically low. This color-coded indication allows users and maintenance staff to easily identify the alcohol status at a glance and take timely action. The system also features a security module, which provides secure access and anti-tampering capability; the module detects physical enclosure integrity using sensors and can trigger alarms or remotely lock the system in case of unauthorized activity, thereby providing the reliability and security of the device.

<summary> <strong>üîÅ IPO Diagram</strong></summary>

<img width="868" height="601" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e46026c-f7c0-4197-8ea4-7853b76f3fc4" />

<div align="justify">
The IPO (Input-Process-Output) model depicts the functional process of the automatic hand sanitizing system. Sensor activation and power supply, and presence of user, are initiators of the system in the Input stage. The system moves to the process stage upon activation of the sensor by the user, initiating the hand sanitizing using an alcohol dispenser. Simultaneously, the system sends operational information updates such as alcohol levels and system status to the Arduino Cloud via IoT for remote access and monitoring; the backend also displays usage data on a chart, showcasing how many times the sensor has detected an object‚Äîi.e., how many times it has dispensed sanitizer‚Äîover selectable timeframes such as 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, and 15 days. Finally, the Output stage shows real-time data on the LCD indicating current alcohol levels and system operation as well as cleaned hands to the user, thus offering both user hygiene and maintenance. An LED indicator is also included in the output, showing red, yellow, or green lights to visually represent low, medium, and full alcohol levels respectively.

The model showcases the design of the microcontroller-based automatic hand sanitation dispenser that is compact and efficient for Emilio Aguinaldo College - Manila Building 7. The system incorporates major components such as an ESP32 microcontroller for IoT an IR sensor for automatic hand detection, a water pump for regulated alcohol dispensing, and an ultrasonic sensor to check the level of the alcohol container. A TFT display integrated to provide information on the present alcohol content and the system's status. Additionally, an LED indicator is positioned on the front of the dispenser to provide a quick visual cue of the alcohol level status: green for full, yellow for half, and red for empty. This combination of digital and visual feedback ensures user convenience and supports efficient system maintenance.
